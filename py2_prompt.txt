PY-2 ASSIGNMENT DETAILS
-----------------------

Due Date:
---------
12:00 Noon, April 26th, 2023

Special Rules for PY Assignments:
---------------------------------
 - Submit as many times as you want before the deadline:
	- MUSC’s time isn’t valuable - try until you get the grade you want
	- When it’s good enough you’re done (enjoy your weekend anxiety-free)
 - You are allowed (and encouraged) to work together on all PY assignments
	- You must list everyone you work with in the comments
 - You are allowed to take the code from anywhere on the internet, but:
	- You must include links to sources in the comments
	- You must understand and be able to explain how every line works
	- If it looks funky I will ask questions

Instructions for Using MUSC:
----------------------------
To get an assignment graded by MUSC, Send an email to:
musc.pdx@gmail.com

The E-mail must:
 - be from an @pdx.edu email address
 - only have one number in the Subject: the assignment number
 				(Anything else is OK, but only one number)

MUSC will evaluate the email & assign a grade.

Problem Overview:
-----------------
MUSC is helping Tim 'The Toolman' Taylor is build an electric hot rod for the big race.
He is trying to beat Al Boreland, Mike Baxter, and Tim's nemisis: Bob Vila.
They have asked for your help to add "more power" to his car and leave the competition in the dust.
Specifically, they need your help to design the battery pack.

Lithium Ion Battery Packs:
--------------------------
Lithium Ion Battery packs consist of individual Lithium Ion cells wired together.
How the individual cells are wired together determines the voltage and current of the battery pack.
The configuration of a battery pack can be described by an S number and a P number.

The S number is the number of battery banks that are wired in series.
It determines the voltage of the battery pack.
The P number is the number of parallel cells per battery bank.
It determines the current of the battery pack.

For example, a "14S6P" battery would have 14 banks of 6 cells each, and contain a total of 14 * 6 = 84 cells.
In comparision, a "15S5P" battery has 15 banks of 5 cells each and would provide more voltage but less current.
With only 75 cells, the 15S5P would also be lighter, but contain less overall power.

Assignment Instructions:
------------------------
For PY-2 you will be tuning the performance of a battery pack.
Your job is to Send MUSC an email that contains the The "SP" Number you wish to try in the first line of the email.
For example, if you want to try a "1S2P" battery, make the first line of your email:
1S2P

MUSC will build your battery, watch the race, give you the highlights, and tell you the results.

Technical Details:
------------------
The goal in this assignment is to pick an S number and P number for the hot rod's battery pack and beat the other racers.
MUSC will build a pack for Tim based on your design and tell you how the race goes.

MUSC has run the calculations and determined that the battery affects the hot rod's race time in 3 ways:
    - The S number improves voltage and therefore top speed
    - The P number improves current and therefore torque & acceleration
    - The Weight of the battery reduces top speed and acceleration.

MUSCs has developed an equation that accurately predicts the performance of the hot rod based on the battery design,
but hasn't had time to crunch the numbers and find a good configuration.

That's where you come in.

In this assignment you are tasked with designing a battery pack that that balances voltage, current, and weight.
The goal is to design a battery that outperforms the other hot rods and minimizes the time to complete the race.
Below you will find MUSC's calculations which you can use to design the battery and tune the performance of your hot rod.
Minimize t_total and beat out the other racers.

On your marks, get set, go!

MUSCs calculations:
-------------------
The weight of the battery can be calculated as:
    w_battery = w_per_battery_cell * S * P

The weight of the hot rod is equal to the weight of the battery plus the cars "dry" weight:
    w_total = w_dry + w_battery

The race time of the hot rod can be calculated as:
    t_total = t_no_power - k_speed * speed_max - k_accel * accel_max
Where:
    - t_no_power is the time of the hot rod without a battery
    - k_speed is the impact of the top speed on the race time
    - k_accel is the impact of the acceleration on the race time

speed_max is defined as:
    speed_max = k_voltage * S - k_speed_weight * w_total
Where:
    - k_voltage is the impact of the S number on top speed
    - k_speed_weight is the impact of weight on top speed

accel_max is defined as:
    accel_max = k_current * P - k_torque_weight * w_total
Where:
    - k_current is the impact of the P number on acceleration
    - k_accel_weight is the impact of weight on acceleration

Grading:
--------
Out of 10 points:
 - 1 for correctly submitting an email
 - 1 for submitting an email where MUSC could find the SP number
 - up to 8 points for the performance of the hot rod:
     - 8 points for 1st place
		 - 7 points for 2nd place
		 - 5 points for 3rd place
		 - 0 points for last place

Note: Race Times are NOT comparable between students, but challenge equally difficult in all cases.
      Race outcomes and grades are consistent (comparably-close tunings recieve same grade).

Tuning Tips:
------------
Each other driver has a particular problem with their design.
If your design is performing similar to theirs, consider the following:
 - Mike's car has plenty of power, but is too heavy
 - Al's car has plenty of speed but not enough torque.
 - Bob's car is close, but it's missing something...

Hints:
------
Solve however you like, but STRONGLY suggest using matplotlib and numpy to evaulate problem.
- One dimensional plots will get you in the ballpark
- Two dimensional plots will get you to a good value much faster
- Also possible to solve with multivariable calculus
- Also possible to solve with guess & check... but it will take a while.
